#ECE 2524: Intro To Unix
#Anamitra Bose
#Assignment Assignment README


#Relevance to Course:

This assignment gives the user a good fundamental understanding of pipes and filters which is essential to the development of more complex scripting skills. In addition, it also provides the user with a good understanding of data formats and application protocols. 

After completing this assignment, the user should be able to read in lines on data, manipulate it in a certain way and then output lines of data. In addition, the user should also be able to make the transition from manipulating data in a pre-defined manner that is mentioned in the program itself to actually defining teh way in which the data is manipulated. In doing so, the user is essentially creating a mini-language that can be used to write a short action file which tells the program what kind of defined actions it will perform on its input data.

#Grading

Since there are three essential Unix command line tasks that are to be performed, the actual content of the three tasks should make up 60% of the overal grade where each of the tasks is 20%. Partial credit will be given for answers close to producing the correct output. The partial credit penalties are listed below:

- -20% for no answer
- -2% off for each syntax error
- -2% off for each missing or incorrect option that could be fixed to produce the correct output
- -5% off for each missing or incorrect filter that could be fixed to produce the correct output
- -5% off for each missing or incorrect argument that could be fixed to produce the correct output
- -10% off if the command line does not produce the output as expected
- -15% off if the command line does not produce any output
